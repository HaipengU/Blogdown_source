# About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Morota Lab](http://morotalab.org/) at the Department of Animal and Poultry Sciences 
at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. My overarching research interest is to leverage statistical methods and bioinformatics to better understand the genotype-phenotype map in animal and plant genetics. Particularly, I am interested in developing and applying statistical methods to the whole-genome prediction of complex traits and genome-wide association analysis.
